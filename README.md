# TOFL: Time Optimized Federated Learning

Vehicular networks face cyber threats that can harm drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. In this scenario, federated learning is a possible solution to train models that detect threats without violating user privacy. However, federated learning is particularly sensitive to communication delays, which is a natural consequence of high mobility in vehicular networks. This problem is commonly ignored in the literature, which does not consider the possibility of network disconnections. This work proposes a client selection strategy designed to minimize the training time of a machine learning model for vehicular threat detection, considering the communication time that varies according to the movement of clients. The results demonstrate that TOFL, using only 20% of the total available clients, can reduce the time required to achieve high accuracy by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the resource consumption of client devices.

This repository contains the code developed for SBSeg 2025. The code is composed by three parts. The first part simulates vehicles mobility, to extract this pattern to estimate the user delays, on the second part, using 5G technology. Finally, the third part simulates the federated learning training, given the latency values obtained during the first and second parts. The object is to test different client selection strategies in a scenario with mobility.

# Security considerations

Our code only uses CSV files pre-processed from simulated CAM data. Therefore, this code does not impose any risk for the host during its execution.

# Considered Stamps

We aim to obtain all four stamps from the conference: available, functional, sustainable, and reproducible.


# Minimum Requirement

- SO: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- Cores: 2
- Memory: 4 GB
- Storage: 64 GB

## Estimated execution time

The time must vary due to your networking conditions to get the necessary packages. Also, the whole execution time depends on the hyperparameters chosen to the test. Therefore, we select 5 cars and 3 epochs for the minimum test, which should take around 30 minutes to build from scracht the whole environment.

# Virtual machine

The whole environment was virtualized to make the execution easier. You can download the virtual machine image on the following address:
```bash
https://gta.ufrj.br/~airam/tofl.ova
```
Execute all commands with root user.
```bash
user: root
password: SBS3g2025
```

# Installation

## Conda

### Get the script to install miniconda
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Change script permissions
```bash
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Execute installation
```bash
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Run environment
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## TOFL

### Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AiramL/TimeOptimizedFederatedLearning.git
```
### Change to the new directory
```bash
cd TimeOptimizedFederatedLearning
```

### Create paths:
```bash
source scripts/build/paths.sh
```

### Accept the terms:
During the installation of dependencies and environment you might be asked to accept the terms of conda and SUMO. Make sure to enter yes. Also, conda enmvironment must be activated after its installation.

### Install dependecies:
```bash
source scripts/build/dependencies.sh
```

### Create the virtual environment:
```bash
source scripts/build/env.sh
```

### Download datasets:
```bash
source scripts/build/datasets.sh
```

# Execution

All the codes were executed with root user on a virtual machine.


## Minimum test

We consider that the minimum test is to reproduce the figures in the paper. Therefore, we provide a simplified execution, which takes the data generated by our code. However, to test from scratch, we also provide a guide to do the complete execution, which takes a long time to generate all the requirements.

### Create SUMOs' trips: 
 
```bash
source scripts/run/raw/mobility.sh
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

### Process trips:

```bash
source scripts/run/processed/mobility.py
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

### Generate raw communication:
 
```bash
source scripts/run/raw/communication.sh
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

### Generate processed communication:

```bash
source scripts/run/processed/communication.sh
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

### Generate delay results:

Parameters: 

This script selects the clients and generates the communication delay result for different algorithms:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

Expected time


The previous python script generates several CSV files, which must be aggregated in order to be consumed. This can be doen by executing the following script:
```bash
python process_results/aggregate_individual_results.py
```
Expected output: 
```bash
```

Another process that we should do is the delays per epoch, in order to show on the graphs:
```bash
python process_results/process_epoch.py
```

Expected output: 
```bash
```
